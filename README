Preshack
--------
A quick hack for making presentations in a new and different way.

Well, the 'quick' part maybe isn't true any more, as I've been using it for several years.

Building
--------
Get ftjam.
Run: jam -j4

Running
-------
cd dist
./hack README.hack


I've bundled in various SIGGRAPH and Eurographics presentations to give you a flavor for what preshack can do.
